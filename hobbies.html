									<p align="justify">In my free time, I indulge in a variety of hobbies and interests that enrich my life outside of the tech world. I have a strong passion for programming and working on personal projects, where I can explore new ideas and sharpen my skills in a creative and hands-on way, just like this portfolio website I have created for myself. Cooking is another favorite pastime of mine, allowing me to experiment with different flavors and techniques to whip up delicious meals for myself and loved ones. When I'm not coding or in the kitchen, you can often find me immersed in a captivating novel, escaping into different worlds and narratives through the pages of a book. I also enjoy unwinding with a good movie, exploring various genres and storytelling styles on the big screen or from the comfort of my own home.</p>
									<p align="justify">On the physical activity front, I'm a keen enthusiast of both badminton and table tennis, finding joy in the fast-paced and competitive nature of these sports. Additionally, I adore spending time with pets, whether it's playing fetch with a dog or cuddling up with a cat, their companionship brings me immense happiness and relaxation.</p>
									<p align="justify">Outside of personal interests, I'm deeply committed to giving back to the community through volunteering. From 2016 to 2020, I dedicated my time and efforts to Crescent Blood Donors, an NGO run by students aimed at helping individuals find blood during medical emergencies. Through this volunteer work, I was able to make a meaningful impact on the lives of others while also fostering a sense of empathy and compassion within myself.</p>
