									<p align="justify">My educational journey has been a mix of exciting experiences and a quest for learning about technology and IT.  It all began with my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering, at B.S. Abdur Rahman Crescent Institute of Science and Technology in Chennai, India. Here, I immersed myself in a comprehensive curriculum that laid the groundwork for my understanding of core concepts such as algorithms, data structures, operating systems, and cloud computing. Guided by passionate educators and surrounded by a community of like-minded individuals, I thrived in an environment that fostered curiosity and encouraged exploration, which eventually led me to publish my works. One of the key achievements during this period was being awarded the Outstanding Achievement in Academics Award for being the topper of the CSE department in the academic year 2017-2018 with a CGPA of 9.94 during the second year of the B.Tech program.</p>
									<p align="justify">Building upon the strong foundation laid during my undergraduate studies, I embarked on a new chapter of academic excellence with a Master of Science (MSc) in Software Engineering of Distributed Systems at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I was awarded the KTH Scholarship based on academic excellence and motivation to contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals with a degree from KTH. This transformative experience allowed me to delve deeper into specialized areas within the realm of software engineering, with a particular focus on data science. Throughout my master's program, I engaged in coursework that challenged me to think critically, analyze complex systems, and develop innovative solutions to real-world problems. From distributed systems and data mining to artificial intelligence and software reliability, each course expanded my horizons and equipped me with the skills necessary to thrive in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.</p>
									<p align="justify">At KTH, I had the privilege of being mentored by esteemed professors and collaborating with fellow students who shared my passion for innovation. Beyond the classroom, I actively participated in research projects, attended workshops and seminars, and seized opportunities to contribute to the academic community as a whole. My time at KTH not only broadened my technical expertise but also fostered a spirit of collaboration, resilience, and lifelong learning that continues to shape my journey as a software engineer. Armed with a rich tapestry of experiences and a thirst for knowledge, I am poised to embark on the next chapter of my career, eager to make meaningful contributions to the world of technology and beyond.</p>
