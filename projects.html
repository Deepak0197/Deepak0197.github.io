												<h3>Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning.</h3>
											</header>
											<p align="justify">The project focuses on building a scalable serverless machine learning system for predicting wine quality. The endeavor encompasses the creation of key components including feature pipelines, training pipelines, batch inference pipelines, and user interfaces. Leveraging the Wine Quality dataset, the project aims to develop an efficient and versatile ML service capable of accurately assessing wine quality based on physicochemical properties. Also, we implemented a dynamic dataset where a new data entry is randomly generated each day using GitHub actions, and we predict the quality of the new wine data entry using the ML model that we have created. Through meticulous coding and experimentation, the project endeavors to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience, empowering users to interactively query and visualize predictions through a user-friendly dashboard interface. With a foundation rooted in the principles of scalability and efficiency, the project represents an exciting opportunity to explore the integration of serverless technologies with machine learning to address real-world challenges in wine quality prediction.</p>

												<h3>Sp500 stocks prediction using Machine Learning.</h3>
											</header>
											<p align="justify">The project for course ID2223 at KTH revolves around developing a machine learning model to predict the direction of S&P 500 stocks. Utilizing the random forest regressor algorithm and the Yahoo Finance dataset, the project focuses on accurately forecasting whether stock prices will rise or fall. Structured into distinct pipelines, including EDA and Backfill, Training, Batch Inference, and Feature Pipeline Daily, each stage serves a specific function in streamlining model development and deployment. By leveraging GitHub actions and Hopsworks for storage and deployment, alongside Hugging Face for model deployment, the project aims to deliver timely and accurate predictions to empower investors in making informed decisions about S&P 500 stocks.</p>

												<h3>Indian Sign Language Recognition Using Machine Learning</h3>
											</header>
											<p align="justify">In this innovative project, we developed a real-time hand gesture recognition system using state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our primary objective was to bridge communication barriers for the deaf and mute community by accurately interpreting Indian Sign Language gestures in real-time scenarios. To train our model, we meticulously collected and manually annotated a dataset consisting of 3000 data points for each hand gesture, ensuring robustness and accuracy. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow for machine learning, we implemented a sophisticated pipeline that could accurately recognize and interpret complex hand gestures in varying environmental conditions. The project not only showcased the potential of machine learning in facilitating inclusive communication but also demonstrated the practical application of cutting-edge technologies in addressing real-world challenges.</p>

											<h2>Chennai Water Crisis - Data Analysis (2019)</h2>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">This project, presented at ICICA-2019 (Intelligent Computing and Applications - Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, vol 1172, Springer, Singapore), aimed to address the pressing issue of water scarcity in Chennai through comprehensive data analysis within the domain of environmental science. By leveraging datasets related to rainfall patterns, groundwater levels, population growth, and urbanization trends, we sought to gain insights into the severity of drought conditions in Chennai and predict potential exacerbations in the future. Through advanced statistical analysis and predictive modeling techniques, we aimed to provide valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and environmentalists to develop sustainable water management strategies for the region.
