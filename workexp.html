									<p align="justify">In my professional journey, I've had the privilege of gaining valuable experience in the tech industry, where I've had the opportunity to put my knowledge and skills into practice. One significant role I held was as an Associate Software Engineer at Synamedia in Chennai, India. During my time there, I was involved in developing enterprise software solutions, focusing particularly on the eRDK (Enterprise Reference Design Kit) project. In this role, I worked on tasks such as collecting Telemetry Data from Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) devices and sending it to the Cloud. I gained hands-on experience with C++, Linux-based systems, and embedded software, all while operating in an Agile development environment.</p>
									<p align="justify">One of the highlights of my experience at Synamedia was my involvement in refining device configuration management using Xconf and working on both RDK-Broadband and RDK-Video components. I collaborated closely with a team of talented individuals, contributing to the manual testing of Comcast CBRv2 routers and developing new features. Through these experiences, I not only enhanced my technical skills but also learned the importance of effective teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability in a fast-paced industry.</p>
									<p align="justify">Currently, I am continuing to expand my horizons as a Master Thesis Student at Ericsson in Luleå, Sweden. Here, I am engaged in groundbreaking research focused on climate control optimization in radio base stations using AI and machine learning techniques. This role allows me to apply my academic knowledge to real-world challenges while contributing to the advancement of technology in a meaningful way. Additionally, I am honored to serve as a Student Ambassador at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, where I actively support and engage with the academic community and the upcoming students.</p>
